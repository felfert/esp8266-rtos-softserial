# A softserial implementation for ESP8266-RTOS

This repository is intended to be included as a component for ESP8266 projects
which use Espressif's ESP8266\_RTOS\_SDK.

To achieve this, you have 2 options:

 1. Offline: Copy this directory to <YourProject>/components/softserial
 2. Online: Add this repository as a submodule in your project.

## ATTENTION: This is WIP, currently still untested!
